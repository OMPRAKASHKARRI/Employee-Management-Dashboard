# 🌐 API Used

JSONPlaceholder

```
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
```

HTTP Methods Used

- GET
- POST
- PUT
- DELETE

---

# 📌 Assumptions

Since JSONPlaceholder does not provide

- First Name
- Last Name
- Department

the application performs local data transformation.

- Full Name is split into First Name and Last Name.
- Department values are generated locally.
- 100 mock users are generated from the original 10 users to demonstrate pagination, filtering, sorting, and CRUD functionality without modifying the backend.

---

# ⚠ Challenges Faced

- JSONPlaceholder stores only 10 users.
- PUT and DELETE operations on locally generated users are not supported by the mock API.
- To provide a complete CRUD experience, local state management was implemented after successful API simulation.
- Pagination was demonstrated by generating additional mock users while keeping the original API unchanged.

---

# 🚀 Future Improvements

- Authentication & Authorization
- Dark Mode
- Export Users to CSV
- Server-side Pagination
- Real Backend Integration
- Unit Testing
- Role-Based Access Control
